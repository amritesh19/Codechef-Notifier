# Codechef-Notifier
No more waiting

In most of the Codechef contests, we have to face open many tabs in our browser and have to look at submitted problems repeatedly (because of large queuing time). This comes as a major distration during contest. This is the solution, this chrome extension will notify the users about their verdict in the contest (when it becomes available). I have not added the Subtask result and image in the notification for keeping it simple (for now), I will improve it in near future. 

Do try it!
